1.	Write a function that takes as input a number and outputs its square.

2.	How do you declare a function that takes as input an integer and a double and returns a char?

3.	Suppose you have a function gcd(a, b) that finds the gcd of two numbers. Write a program that takes as input 10 integers and finds their gcd. You can assume that the gcd function is implemented.

4.	void makeSum(int a, int b, int *sum)
The above function takes as input two integers a and b and stores their sum in the variable sum. Implement the function.
 
5.	Find the output of the following code.
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int *p = &a;
printf(“%d %d %d\n”, a, b, *p);
*p = 30;
printf(“%d %d %d\n”, a, b, *p);
*p = 20;
a = 50;
b = 10;
printf(“%d %d %d\n”, a, b, *p);
p = &b;
printf(“%d %d %d\n”, a, b, *p);
a = 20;
b = 100;
printf(“%d %d %d\n”, a, b, *p);


6.	void makeNArray(int n, int squares[]) populates squares with first n square numbers. For example, makeNarray(4, squares) will populate squares with 1, 4, 9, 16. Implement the function. 

7.	How can you use the return by address mechanism to return two integers from a function? Explain with an example. 

8.	stringCat(char a[], char b[], char out[]) The strcat function takes two strings and contacts them and outputs them to a out. Assume that out has enough space to hold contents of both a and b. Implement the function.


9.	Write a program using pointers to read in an array of integers and Print its elements in reverse order.

10.	The main is a user-define function. How does it differ from other user-defined functions?
