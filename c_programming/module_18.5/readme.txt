1.	Write a function that takes no input and prints the number of times the function has been called. Hint: Use static variables.
	
 	Example: printCall(); printCall(); printCall();  will print 
“Called 1 times”
“Called 2 times”
“Called 3 times”
		   
2.	Suppose you have a global variable number. Write three functions -
a.	set (int v)   	-> updates number to v.
b.	makedouble()	-> doubles number.
c.	print()		-> prints the current value of number.
	
 	Example: 
		set(10);			//v is now 10
		set(5);			//v is now 5
		print();			//prints 5
		makedouble();		//v is now 10
		makedouble();		//v is now 20
		print();			//prints 20


3.	Write a C function that takes an integer and reverses its digits. The function should have the signature void reverse(int* ).
 
4.	The function sort(int *a, int *b) sorts the variables a, b by their value. If a is smaller, the function does nothing, otherwise it swaps them. Implement the function.
 
5.	Use the above function to sort three integers a, b, c by their value. After sorting a should have the smallest value, b should have the second smallest, c the largest value. Hint: It should take three function calls.


6.	Write a function that outputs the element wise sum of two equal sized array. It should have the signature void add(int a[], int b[], int sum[]). Use the sum variable for outputting the sum.
Example: a = {1, 2, 3}, b = {2, 3, 4}. Then sum should be {3, 5, 7}


7.	Write a function that as input n and outputs an a
