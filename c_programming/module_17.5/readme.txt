  ## problem set
 
2. Write a function to find the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
 
3. Write a function that will take an array and find its maximum.
 
4. Write a function which will right rotate an array by k. For example, array a has the values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. 
If we call Rotate(a). Array a will have the values {2, 3, 4, 5, 1}.

5. Write a function which will right rotate an array by k. For example, array a has the values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. 
If we call RotateByK(a, 3). Array a will have the values {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}. You can use the previous function. 
 
6. Suppose, you call Rotate ByK(a, 1000000000). You will find that your program takes a lot of time. How can you optimize your program? 
Hint: What happens when you rotate by the array length?
 
7. Write a function truncate() that takes a string and an integer k, and keeps only the first k characters. 
For example - if s is “abcd”, truncate(s, 2) will make s = “ab”
 
8. Declare three pointers a, b, c. a points to an int, b to an double, c to a char. Find out the values of the following expressions?
a+1
a-2
b+3
b-4
c-5
c+6
a-b

9.In the following code, complete the box such that it prints “20 40”.
const int a = 20;
printf(“%d “, a);
\\\Write code here.

printf(“%d “, a);


10. Asma wrote the following function to make an integer positive. 
void makePositive(int a) {
	if (a < 0) {
		a = -a;
	}
	}

	Will it work? If not, how can she fix it?
