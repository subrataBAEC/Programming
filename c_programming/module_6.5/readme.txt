#C programming 
####Contents :
3.  Write a C program to check whether a given non-negative number is a multiple of 3 or 7, but not both.  For example: inputs 7, 3, 6, 14 should output yes. Inputting 21, 42 should output no.

4.	Write a C program that reads an integer between 1 and 12 and print the month of the year in English.  Use switch case.
Input :
Input a number between 1 to 12 to get the month name: 8
Expected Output:
August

5. Write a C program that will first read an integer n, then read n integers. From those, it will find the sum of even integers.
Example:
Enter n: 5
Input 5 integers: 2 3 5 6 7
Sum of even integers = 8

8.	Write a C program to check whether an alphabet is a vowel or consonant.

9.	Fizzbuzz is a very well known problem. Given a positive integer N, you need to print n lines.For multiples of 3, you should print Fizz.
 For the multiples of 5, you should print Buzz. For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, print “FizzBuzz”.
 In other cases, print the current line number.
Example
Input: 5
Output:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz

11.	 Write a program in C that takes two inputs x and y and prints all numbers that are multiples of x but divisors of y.  If there are none, print no such integers.
Test Data :
5 20
Expected Output :
5 10 20
Test Data :
6 20
Expected Output :
No such integers
